# Pensyv Website

## Introduction

Our mission is simple... we want to help you measure what matters most: mental health. Pensyv is developing an app to help you log and visualize mental health over time. Alpha testers can participate by creating a user profile and filling out a simple daily questionnaire in less time than it takes to listen to their favorite song. Users can track their questionnaire reponses over time via data visualizations on the homepage. User and questionnaire data are posted to the backend, where they are then stored on a secure database. Privacy is a top priority; users can leave alpha testing anytime by removing their profile and all associated data. Future versions of the app will incorporate sophisticated statistical analyses and will enable users to opt in to data sharing for macro-level research.
